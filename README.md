# SandboxCPP

This repository serves as a personal sandbox for exploring and experimenting with various aspects of C++. It's a place to try out new language features, test different approaches to problem-solving, and generally play around with C++ code.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this sandbox are:

*   **Learning:** To deepen my understanding of C++ by actively using and experimenting with its features.
*   **Prototyping:** To quickly prototype and test ideas before incorporating them into larger projects.
*   **Exploration:** To explore new libraries, techniques, and paradigms within the C++ ecosystem.

## Contents

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a specific area of exploration. Examples include:

*   **Algorithms:** Implementations and tests of various algorithms.
*   **Data Structures:** Implementations and experiments with different data structures.
*   **Concurrency:** Exploration of multi-threading and concurrency in C++.
*   **Modern C++:** Experiments with C++11/14/17/20 features.
*   **SandBox:** Just a trash can of testing.
